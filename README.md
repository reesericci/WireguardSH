# THIS PROJECT IS NOW DEPRECATED. 
### Due to PiVPN now supporting Wireguard I have decided to deprecate this project as PiVPN is a much better script than this one.

# WireguardSH | an easy way to create clients in WireGuard

It is a pain to make new clients in WireGuard, that is no more with WireguardSH!

## How to use the script:

1. login as root
2. run the command `curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reesericci/WireguardSH/releases/v1.0/wireguardsh` then run `chmod +x wireguardsh`
3. Rename all server keys to server_publickey and server_privatekey
3. run a `sudo cp wireguardsh /usr/bin`
4. To use the script type in `wireguardsh`
4. Give it your Client name, IP address for the client, your DNS server address (Setup a pi-hole if you havent already), your public IP, and your WireGuard port.

To uninstall type in `sudo rm /usr/bin/wireguardsh`

## Things to note:
The script will create a directory tree of client, keys
 
Inside the client folder there will be the client configs from the script.
 
Inside the keys folder there will be a directory tree of server, client.
 
Inside keys/client there is another tree of public, private.
 
Inside keys/server there is the same tree.
 
Inside keys/client/private there are private keys for the client,ect.
 
It will automattically move all server keys into the keys/server folder
